# Skin Disease Detection Website

Welcome to our Skin Disease Detection Website, a cutting-edge platform designed to assist in the early diagnosis and treatment of various skin diseases using deep learning technology.

## Overview

Skin diseases affect millions of people worldwide, often requiring expert diagnosis and timely treatment to prevent complications. Our website offers a user-friendly interface where users can upload images of their skin conditions. The system then analyzes the images using advanced deep learning algorithms to provide a preliminary diagnosis.


## How It Works
1. **Home and About page**: Containes information about the website and Dataset.
