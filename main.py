## Our Mission

Skin diseases are a challenging group of conditions that can be categorized into those that are commonly seen and easily recognized based on the characteristic site of presentation, size, color, distribution, and symptoms. Understanding the different types of skin diseases and their characteristics is crucial for accurate diagnosis and treatment.
Skin diseases are classified into the following 10 categories:

1. **Eczema**
   

2. **Melanoma**
   

3. **Atopic Dermatitis**
   

4. **Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)**
   

5. **Melanocytic Nevi (NV)**
   

6. **Benign Keratosis-like Lesions (BKL)**
   

7. **Psoriasis pictures Lichen Planus and related diseases**
   

8. **Seborrheic Keratoses and other Benign Tumors**
   

9. **Tinea Ringworm Candidiasis and other Fungal Infections**
   

10. **Warts Molluscum and other Viral Infections**
    

Each category of skin diseases presents unique characteristics and challenges in diagnosis and treatment. By categorizing them based on common features such as the site of presentation, size, color, distribution, and symptoms, healthcare professionals can more easily identify and manage these conditions.

## How It Works

Our platform uses state-of-the-art deep learning models to analyze uploaded images of skin conditions and predict the potential disease. Here's a quick overview of how it works:

1. **Upload an Image**: Simply upload a clear image of the affected skin area.
2. **AI Analysis**: Our AI model processes the image and runs a series of diagnostics.
3. **Get Results**: Receive a detailed report on the detected skin condition along with possible treatment options.


## Why Choose Us?

### **Accuracy**

Our AI models are trained on hundreds of images to ensure high accuracy in detecting various skin diseases, from common conditions like eczema to more serious concerns like melanoma.

### **Ease of Use**

Our platform is designed with user experience in mind. The interface is simple and straightforward, making it easy for anyone to use, regardless of technical skill.

### **Comprehensive Database**

We cover a wide range of skin conditions, ensuring that you receive accurate diagnostics for numerous skin issues.

### **Security and Privacy**

We prioritize your privacy. All uploaded images and personal data are securely stored and processed, ensuring that your information remains confidential.

                This dataset consists of about 27.2K rgb images of  diseased skin which is categorized into 10 different classes.The total dataset is divided into 80/10 ratio of training and validation set preserving the directory structure.
                A new directory containing 564 test images is created later for prediction purpose.
